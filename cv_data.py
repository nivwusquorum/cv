My biggest achievement was designing and implementing real-time reserialization of traffic (Twitter stormguys approve: "we did not implement it because shit seemed hard"). There were also countless little features that were included - automatically created statistics,quick and simple adding of new handlers, automated failure recovery, message aggregation, Redis based queuing system, separation of traffic into scopes and ofcourse porting all the traffic from old system to new system. By the time I left all of Dropbox was running it and we had large portion of users shadowed.'
